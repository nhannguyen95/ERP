This is the exercise for **Information System and Enterprise Resources Planing (IS and ERP)** course. You can find here the (simple) implementation for the following 6 algorithms:
* Matrix Factorization
* Biased Matrix Factorization
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Factor Method
* The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
* Fuzzy AHP

The detail information is in `README` files in each algorithm's folder.
